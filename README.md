# Banking-System
Developed an Application for Banking that provides minimal
features of a Banking System. This project uses classes and file
handling features of C++. This Application is based on a concept
of recording customer’s account details.
Here the user can perform all the tasks like creating an account,
deposit amount, withdraw amount, check balance, view all
account holder’s details, close an account and so on.
